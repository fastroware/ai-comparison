Please make me the HTML CSS JS coding in 1 file, where there is a checkout button (placed in the middle vertically and horizontally), and I want the theme to be orange. OK, so when the button is clicked, basically whether you want to make an animation is up to you, the important thing is to use HTML, CSS and JS, where the animation will show that the checkout is processed and then successful.

Basically, the animation is like there is a shopping basket which then goes into the box and is then processed like that, and after that success appears.

So what I mean is, the animation is not simple animation, but complex and cool and modern animation. It's up to you what library you want to use, the important thing is CDN.

Please provide complete coding in 1 file. and make sure it is responsive for PC and mobile
